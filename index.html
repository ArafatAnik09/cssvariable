        <p>In five years, I see myself as a skilled web developer, creating user-friendly websites and apps. I'll have gained a lot of experience working on different projects, both alone and with teams. My goal is to solve real problems with my work and make sure websites work well on all devices.</p>
        <p>I want to be known for being good at fixing problems and finding new ways to make websites better. I also want to learn how to manage projects and communicate well with others in my field.

        Outside of work, I plan to have a good balance between my job and personal life. I'll spend time with family and friends, and I'll do things that make me happy and keep me healthy. In five years, I hope to be a successful and satisfied web developer, making a positive impact with my work and enjoying life along the way.</p>
